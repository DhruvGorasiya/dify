Migration script to fix Weaviate schema incompatibility between 1.19.0 and 1.27.0+

This script:
- Identifies collections with old schema (no vectorConfig)
- Creates new collections with proper vectorConfig including "default" named vector
- Migrates data using cursor-based pagination (efficient for large datasets)
- Uses batch operations for fast inserts
- Preserves all object properties and vectors
